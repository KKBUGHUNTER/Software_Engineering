## Software Project plan
A project plan is a series of formal documents that define the execution and control stages of a project. The plan includes considerations for risk management, resource management and communications, while also addressing scope, cost and schedule baselines. Project planning software is used by project managers to ensure that their plans are thorough and robust.
  - Project plan must be flexible and iterative.
  - It meets the needs of stakeholders and reviewed by stakeholders.
  - Project plan should include :
    1. Estimation - Size, resource, defect (the number of defects projected for the work) and test plan (some cases) estimation.
    2. Schedule - Depends on the development tasks item Risk - Occurance in project.
    3. Quality
    4. Change management

## Project Plan Granularity
  - A high-granularity plan provides significant work task detail that is planned over relatively short time increments
  - A low-granularity plan provides broader work tasks that are planned over longer time periods.
A high-granularity plan breaks work into small, detailed tasks for short timeframes, while a low-granularity plan outlines broader tasks scheduled over longer periods.

It encompasses five major activities âˆ’ **estimation, scheduling, risk analysis, quality management planning,** and **change management planning.**


## Planning process
 1. Establish project scope.
 2. Determine feasibility.
 3. Analyze risks
 4. Define required resources.
    1. Determine required human resources
    2. Define reusable software resources.
    3. Identify environmental resources
5. Estimate cost and effort
  1. Decompose the problem
  2. Develop two or more estimates using size, function points, process tasks, or use cases.
  3. Reconcile the estimates.
6. Develop a project schedule.
  1. Establish a meaningful task set. 6b. Define a task network.
  2. Use scheduling tools to develop a timeline chart.
  3. Define schedule tracking mechanisms

### 1. Establish project scope
Determine what the project will achieve and define its boundaries, outlining what's included and what's not.
  - The functions and features that are to be delivered to end users
  - The data that are input and output
  - The content that is presented to users as a consequence of using the software
  - The performance, constraints, interfaces, and reliability that bound the system.
### 2. Determine feasibility
Assess whether the project is possible within constraints like time, budget, resources, and technology.
  - Can we build software to meet this scope?
  - Is the project technically feasible ?
  - Is the project financially feasible ?
  - Will the projects time-to-market beat the competition ?
  - Does the organization have the resources needed to succeed?
### 3. Analyze risks
Identify potential issues or uncertainties that could impact the project's success and create plans to mitigate them.

### 4. Define required resources

- **4.1 Determine required human resources**
    - Figure out the team size, roles, and skills needed for the project.
- **4.2 Define reusable software resources**
    - Identify existing software components or modules that can be used in the project.
- **4.3 Identify environmental resources**
    - Pinpoint any external resources or infrastructure necessary for the project (like hardware, tools, etc.).

### 5. Estimate cost and effort
- **5.1 Decompose the problem**
    - Break down the project into smaller, manageable parts for easier estimation.
- **5.2 Develop two or more estimates**
    - Create different estimations of cost and effort using methods like size measurements, function points, or process tasks.
- **5.3 Reconcile the estimates**
    - Compare and merge different estimates to arrive at a more accurate overall estimation.

### 6. Develop a project schedule
- **6.1 Establish a meaningful task set**
    - Determine the specific tasks needed to complete the project.
- **6.2 Define a task network**
    - Create a structure outlining the sequence and dependencies of tasks (what needs to be done before what).
- **6.3 Use scheduling tools to develop a timeline chart**
    - Utilize software or tools to create a visual timeline showing when tasks will be performed.
- **6.4 Define schedule tracking mechanisms**
    - Establish methods to monitor progress against the schedule, ensuring tasks are completed on time.

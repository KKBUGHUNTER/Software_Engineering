**1. Pre-Software Development:**
   - **Definition:** This phase involves preparing for the software development process by understanding project requirements, setting objectives, and planning the project.

   - **Steps Involved:**
     - Requirement gathering and analysis.
     - Feasibility study to assess project viability.
     - Defining project scope and objectives.
     - Resource planning and allocation.
     - Creating a project schedule and budget.

   - **Benefits:**
     - Ensures a clear understanding of project goals.
     - Helps identify potential risks and challenges.
     - Provides a roadmap for efficient project execution.

**2. Development Specific Phases of the SDLC:**
   - **Definition:** This phase encompasses the core software development process, with specific phases that guide the creation of the software product.

   - **Steps Involved:** Common phases in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) include:
     - Requirements analysis.
     - System design.
     - Implementation (coding).
     - Testing (unit, integration, system, acceptance).
     - Deployment.
     - Maintenance and ongoing support.

   - **Benefits:**
     - Ensures structured and systematic development.
     - Facilitates collaboration among development teams.
     - Allows for thorough testing and quality assurance.
     - Results in a functional and reliable software product.

**3. Post-Software Development:**
   - **Definition:** This phase deals with activities after software development, including deployment, maintenance, and potential updates or enhancements.

   - **Steps Involved:**
     - Deployment and installation of the software.
     - Ongoing maintenance to fix bugs and address issues.
     - User support and training.
     - Potential updates or new feature development based on user feedback and changing requirements.

   - **Benefits:**
     - Ensures the software remains functional and secure.
     - Provides user satisfaction and support.
     - Allows for adaptation to evolving needs and technologies.

## How does SDLC work?

The software development lifecycle (SDLC) outlines several tasks required to build a software application. The development process goes through several stages as developers add new features and fix bugs in the software.
<br>
The details of the SDLC process vary for different teams. However, we outline some common SDLC phases below.

### Plan
The planning phase typically includes tasks like cost-benefit analysis, scheduling, resource estimation, and allocation. The development team collects requirements from several stakeholders such as customers, internal and external experts, and managers to create a software requirement specification document.
<br>
The document sets expectations and defines common goals that aid in project planning. The team estimates costs, creates a schedule, and has a detailed plan to achieve their goals.

### Design
In the design phase, software engineers analyze requirements and identify the best solutions to create the software. For example, they may consider integrating pre-existing modules, make technology choices, and identify development tools. They will look at how to best integrate the new software into any existing IT infrastructure the organization may have.

### Implement
In the implementation phase, the development team codes the product. They analyze the requirements to identify smaller coding tasks they can do daily to achieve the final result.

### Test
The development team combines automation and manual testing to check the software for bugs. Quality analysis includes testing the software for errors and checking if it meets customer requirements. Because many teams immediately test the code they write, the testing phase often runs parallel to the development phase.

### Deploy
When teams develop software, they code and test on a different copy of the software than the one that the users have access to. The software that customers use is called production, while other copies are said to be in the build environment, or testing environment.
<br><br>
Having separate build and production environments ensures that customers can continue to use the software even while it is being changed or upgraded. The deployment phase includes several tasks to move the latest build copy to the production environment, such as packaging, environment configuration, and installation.

### Maintain
In the maintenance phase, among other tasks, the team fixes bugs, resolves customer issues, and manages software changes. In addition, the team monitors overall system performance, security, and user experience to identify new ways to improve the existing software.

PRESCRIPTIVE PROCESS MODELS
  1. Waterfall Model
  2. V Models
  3. Evolutionary Process Models : prototyping,spiral.
  4. Concurrent model

### Waterfall Model
![Screenshot from 2023-12-04 10-06-20](https://github.com/KKBUGHUNTER/Software_Engineering/assets/91019132/0b63984a-0459-4ece-83b9-2159374422ff)

**Definition**
The waterfall model is a linear and sequential approach to software development, progressing through phases like requirements, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance.

**When to Use**
Ideal for projects with well-defined and stable requirements where changes are expected to be minimal.

**Advantages**
- Clear and structured approach with distinct phases.
- Well-suited for projects with fixed scope and requirements.
- Simple and easy to understand.

**Disadvantages**
- Inflexible to changes once a phase is completed.
- Limited opportunity for customer feedback until late stages.
- High risk of not accommodating changes effectively.

**Application**
For instance, building a basic website with a predefined set of features where requirements are unlikely to change significantly.

### V-Model

**Definition**
The V-Model, an extension of the waterfall model, emphasizes a structured approach to software development, with a focus on testing and validation at each stage of the development life cycle. It aligns testing phases directly with development phases, forming a V-shaped progression.

**When to Use**
Best suited for projects that demand a strong emphasis on testing and validation at each stage, ensuring high software quality.

**Advantages**
- **Testing Emphasis:** Strong focus on testing, leading to higher software quality.
- **Clear Structure:** Well-structured process with defined phases.
- **Early Defect Detection:** Allows for early detection and rectification of defects.
- **Alignment with Requirements:** Suitable for projects with well-defined and stable requirements.

**Disadvantages**
- **Limited Flexibility:** Not very flexible to changes once a phase is initiated.
- **Time-Consuming:** Can be time-consuming for large and complex projects.
- **Feedback Delay:** May lead to delayed feedback as testing is often at the end of each phase.

**Application**
For instance, in the development of a medical device software where strict validation and testing standards are crucial at every stage to ensure safety and reliability.

### Incremental Process Model
![Screenshot from 2023-12-04 10-24-16](https://github.com/KKBUGHUNTER/Software_Engineering/assets/91019132/9bfe6faa-2ff8-44e8-b5b4-171c35665c43)

**Definition**
The incremental model breaks down the software development process into smaller, manageable increments, each delivering a portion of the functionality.

**When to Use**
Suitable for projects where early releases of partial functionality are beneficial or where requirements are likely to evolve.

**Advantages**
- Allows for early releases of usable software.
- Easier to test and debug smaller modules.
- Flexibility to incorporate changes in later increments.

**Disadvantages**
- Needs thorough planning for increments.
- Requires good initial design.
- Potential for integration issues with new increments.

**Application**
Developing a mobile app with core functionalities released in phases, allowing users to benefit from basic features while more advanced functionalities are being developed.

### Evolutionary Process Model

**Definition**
An evolutionary model focuses on iterative development, refining and evolving the software through successive iterations.

**When to Use**
Ideal for projects where requirements are unclear or subject to change, enabling continuous improvement.

**Advantages**
- Adaptive to changing requirements.
- Early prototypes for user feedback.
- Allows for frequent refinements based on user input.

**Disadvantages**
- Needs active user involvement throughout.
- May lack structure without proper oversight.
- Requires more time due to continuous iterations.

**Application**
Developing a new software tool where user needs and functionalities are not clearly defined at the beginning.

### Spiral Model
![Screenshot from 2023-12-04 10-25-10](https://github.com/KKBUGHUNTER/Software_Engineering/assets/91019132/7b417ea6-1705-49bd-8302-c28115cfff11)

**Definition**
The spiral model combines iterative development with elements of the waterfall model by emphasizing risk analysis and mitigating strategies.

**When to Use**
Suitable for projects with high risk or complexity, where frequent risk analysis and mitigation are essential.

**Advantages**
- Comprehensive risk management.
- Flexibility in accommodating changes.
- Prototyping allows for early user feedback.

**Disadvantages**
- Complex and can be costly.
- Requires expertise in risk assessment.
- Time-consuming due to multiple iterations.

**Application**
Building a software system for a critical infrastructure where risks need to be continuously evaluated and managed throughout the development process.

### Concurrent Model
![Screenshot from 2023-12-04 10-25-38](https://github.com/KKBUGHUNTER/Software_Engineering/assets/91019132/7da7af5d-ab0c-4f77-b947-d61df3399b03)

**Definition**
The concurrent model emphasizes parallel development, allowing different phases to occur simultaneously.

**When to Use**
Useful for projects where time-to-market is crucial, aiming to reduce overall development time.

**Advantages**
- Reduces development time by running phases concurrently.
- Faster delivery of the final product.
- Allows for immediate feedback and correction.

**Disadvantages**
- Requires strong coordination among teams.
- Risk of integration issues if communication is poor.
- Complex management of parallel activities.

**Application**
Developing a complex software solution where various teams work simultaneously on different modules or components to expedite the delivery schedule.
